# Bone-Separator
ImageJ Plugin to isolate stained bone from HE stained histological slides

This ImageJ plugin requires a RGB image from a HE stained histological slide scan. It splits the original image in two parts : HE based bone stain and the rest of the image, producing a black background. The original image will be preserved.

Installation: 
Just copy the .class file into the imageJ plugin folder and restart ImageJ or use the compile and run option from the plugin menu on the .java file.

Usage:
Load a RGB image into ImageJ, then find the Bone separator in the plugin folder. Images will be separated instantly.
